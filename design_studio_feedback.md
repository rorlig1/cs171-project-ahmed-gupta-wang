We both represents for our team as both of our other teammates are online students.

Our project originally has two goals, the basic one would visualize the data we have in Yelp Challenge dateSet. But we expect that our project could be further developed after we finish our visualization. So it will give a chance for people to analysis the data and play with it using our visualization result. So leads some part of detailed analysis not clear now which cannot ensure any solid solutions.
And we partly devide our goal-- the visual goal at first step and the data analysis goal the next step too extremly. 
Some part of our design is a little over designed or just for esthetic standard.
We use the radius of circle to explain different things in different layout is misunderstanding.

So our team agree that we would focus more on the first step considering the time period. 
And we make our visulization more direct in a way that people would use less time to understand which otherwise may lose attention because of the long process.
We would trigger more interactions for users which will better use the "overdesign" part now.
